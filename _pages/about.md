## About Me

Hello! This is Benyun Zhao (赵犇赟). I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of [Mechanical and Automation Engineering](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), where I obtained my Master's degree in 2021. I am now a member of [Unmanned System Research (USR) group](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~usr/) and [Hong Kong Centre for Logistics Robotics (HKCLR)](https://www.hkclr.hk/), supervised by [_Prof. Ben M. Chen_](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/chen-benmei/) and frequently collaborating with [_Prof. Yunhui Liu_](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/) in CUHK and [_Prof. Mark W. Mueller_](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/mark-w-mueller/) in UC, Berkeley. My work focuses on engineer applications of computer vision based on unmanned systems, such as object detection and segmentation, VLM deployment, image enhancement, 3D scene reconstruction and understanding.

Before I delved fully into research, I worked as a joint research assistant in CUHK and HKCLR from 2021-2022 and had internships in Sinopec Jinling Company and [YTO Group Corporation](http://en.first-tractor.com.cn/#) as Mechanical Engineer during undergraduate.

Outside of work, you will find me photographing.
